    content: `
Strabismus means the eyes don’t line up with each other. One eye may turn in (esotropia), out (exotropia), up (hypertropia) or down (hypotropia). It can be constant or come and go. It may start in infancy or appear later in life.

How it shows up

Children
	•	Brain often suppresses the turned eye to avoid double vision → parents notice a turned eye, head tilt/turn, or clumsiness.
	•	Trouble tracking lines while reading; fatigue.

Teens & adults
	•	Double vision (diplopia) or eye strain, especially when tired or reading.
	•	Headaches, difficulty focusing, squinting or closing one eye in bright light.
	•	Depth perception problems (pouring liquids, stairs, sports, parking).

How it gets in the way
	•	Reading & learning: losing place on the page, slow reading, fatigue.
	•	Depth tasks: stairs, driving, ball sports, precise work (crafts, lab work).
	•	Screens/VR/3D: discomfort or inability to fuse images.
	•	Psychosocial: reduced confidence, teasing/bullying, avoiding eye contact; can affect hiring in roles that value appearance or depth perception.

Why it matters (beyond appearance)
	•	The brain may turn off input from the misaligned eye → loss of binocular vision and stereopsis (true 3D depth).
	•	In children this suppression can become amblyopia (“lazy eye”) — reduced vision that may become permanent if not treated in time.
	•	In adults, persistent double vision and eye strain can be disabling and unsafe (e.g., driving, machinery).

Possible complications if untreated
	•	Amblyopia with irreversible vision loss in the turned eye (childhood risk).
	•	Permanent loss of stereopsis → limited career options (aviation, surgery, military, some technical trades).
	•	Abnormal head posture, chronic neck strain, headaches.
	•	Emotional burden: anxiety/depression, social withdrawal.
	•	Safety risks: falls, traffic incidents, sports injuries.

Red flags that need urgent evaluation
	•	New onset strabismus or new double vision in adults.
	•	Sudden changes with pain, droopy eyelid, or neurologic symptoms (could signal nerve palsy, stroke, tumor, thyroid eye disease, or trauma).

The good news

If there’s no nerve damage, non-invasive training can often improve alignment control, comfort, and everyday performance.
If surgery is needed, structured post op training helps maintain alignment, reduce recurrence, and stabilize binocular vision for longterm success.

	Note: Eye2Eye is designed for daily, at home training. A few minutes a day can support comfort, control, and binocular stability over time. Always partner with your eye care professional for diagnosis

    excerpt: "Amblyopia (lazy eye) ...",
    content: `Amblyopia (“lazy eye”) is reduced vision in one (or rarely both) eyes because the brain favors the other eye. Common causes include anisometropia (unequal glasses power), strabismus, and visual deprivation (e.g., cataract) in early childhood. Without treatment during the critical period, vision can remain permanently reduced.

How it shows up
- Poor acuity in one eye on screening tests.
- Squinting, closing one eye in bright light, head tilt.
- Depth perception problems (catching balls, stairs, sports, parking).

Why it matters
- The amblyopic eye sends a weaker signal; the brain suppresses it → reduced stereopsis and hand eye coordination.
- Academic and sport performance can suffer; kids may avoid near tasks or sports.
- Adults with untreated amblyopia have higher lifetime risk if the “good” eye is injured.

Treatment basics
- Correct refractive error (glasses/contacts).
- Treat cause (e.g., strabismus, opacity).
- Promote use of the weaker eye (patching/atropine) and train binocular function so the eyes work together.

Good news — Eye2Eye can help.
Beyond patching alone, Eye2Eye delivers engaging, home based binocular training that encourages the weak eye to participate while teaching the brain to fuse both images. Families get short, trackable sessions, adherence nudges, and progress stats. After strabismus surgery (when needed), Eye2Eye continues as post-op therapy to stabilize binocular vision and help prevent regression—again, provided there’s no nerve damage.

    excerpt: "Eyepatch",
    content: `An eye patch is a traditional way to treat amblyopia. By covering the stronger eye, the brain is pushed to use the weaker eye so that its visual pathways don’t shut down. In some cases it is also used briefly around strabismus care. The idea is simple: occlude the dominant eye to force neural plasticity on the other one.

In real life, patching often struggles. Children and adults frequently report skin irritation, sweating, and heat under the patch. It draws attention at school or work and can feel stigmatizing, so many people under-wear it or remove it early. Because one eye is fully blocked, the wearer loses depth perception and peripheral awareness while patched, which can cause headaches, eye strain, and safety concerns. Some patients “peek” around the patch, and compliance becomes hard to measure. Most importantly, patching is monocular: it does not train the two eyes to work together, so fusion and stereopsis may remain weak even if acuity improves.

That is why patching alone is increasingly seen as an outdated primary solution for many cases. It can improve acuity in young children with amblyopia when carefully dosed by a clinician, but it does not directly rehabilitate binocular control, vergence, and coordination—the core issues behind strabismus and many amblyopia patterns. In older children and adults, adherence falls and benefits plateau; quality of life costs are high compared to modern, engagement-driven binocular therapies.

Good news: Eye2Eye changes the experience. Instead of blocking one eye, Eye2Eye delivers comfortable, home-usable binocular training that stimulates both eyes to align, fuse, and stay coordinated. Sessions are short and guided, progress is trackable, and there’s no skin irritation or social stigma from a visible patch. If there is no nerve damage, Eye2Eye can be a front-line, non-invasive way to build function; when surgery is needed, Eye2Eye supports post-operation recovery—helping maintain alignment, prevent regression, and stabilize binocular vision for long-term success.

Always follow your eyecare professional’s plan. Eye2Eye is designed to fit into that plan—reducing discomfort, improving adherence, and focusing on what truly matters: durable, binocular vision.`,

    excerpt: "",
    content: `What does strabismus surgery do?
Surgery relaxes or tightens one or more eye muscles so the eyes point to the same target again. The surgeon opens the thin tissue over the muscle, repositions the muscle on the sclera with tiny sutures (often adjustable), and centers the eyes based on measurements from clinic and the operating room. The goal is alignment and a better chance for the brain to use binocular vision.

Recovery
Most people go home the same day. Redness and a “scratchy” feeling are common for 1–2 weeks; vision may feel a bit unstable while the brain adapts. Children usually return to school in a few days; adults often take about a week off work depending on the job. Final alignment is judged over weeks, because muscles and brain adaptation settle gradually.

How often is a second surgery needed?
Outcomes depend on the type of strabismus, age, size of the deviation, and whether there is neurologic or thyroid-eye disease. In routine childhood esotropia or exotropia, a single operation aligns the eyes in many cases, but a meaningful minority need another procedure later as the child grows and the control system changes. In practice, re-operation rates commonly fall in the broad range of roughly 20–40% over the long term, with exotropia tending to drift more than esotropia. Complex cases (very large angles, sensory strabismus, thyroid eye disease, cranial-nerve palsy) have higher re-operation needs. Your own surgeon’s numbers and your specific diagnosis matter most.

When is surgery essential?
If strabismus is caused by cranial nerve damage (III, IV, or VI palsy) or by restrictive disease, prism glasses and injections may help symptoms, but surgery is often required to bring the eyes into a safer, more functional position. In acute nerve palsy some surgeons wait a few months to see if function returns; when it doesn’t, surgery is the durable way to restore alignment, expand the field of single vision, and reduce abnormal head posture.

Limits to understand
Surgery moves muscles; it does not “force” the brain to fuse images. Without good neurosensory training, eyes can drift again—especially with fatigue, growth, or near-work load. Some diplopia can persist in complex neurologic cases even after good alignment in primary gaze.

Good news — where Eye2Eye fits
Eye2Eye focuses on what happens after the operation: stabilizing binocular function. By guiding short, home-based neuromuscular and fusion exercises, Eye2Eye helps the brain keep both eyes “online,” reduces suppression and asthenopia, and supports longterm alignment. In plain terms: surgeons straighten the eyes; Eye2Eye helps the brain keep them working together—especially valuable after surgery and in any case without permanent nerve damage. If nerve damage is permanent, Eye2Eye still supports post-op rehabilitation to maximize the field of single vision and comfort, but it doesn’t replace medical or surgical care.`,

    excerpt: "",
    content: `When we talk about the Global Burden of Disease (GBD), we’re adding up two things:

• YLDs — Years Lived with Disability
• YLLs — Years of Life Lost

Together they tell us how much healthy life the world is losing. But for most eye conditions (like strabismus and amblyopia), the story isn’t about death  it’s about disability. That’s where the biggest gains are hiding.

What the numbers say
• YLDs (years lived with disability): ~750–900 million years globally  every year, people spend an enormous time living below their full visual and functional potential.
• YLLs (fewer healthy years due to earlier death): ~2.1 million years. Eye disease rarely kills, but poor vision can contribute to accidents, injuries, and overall health risks.

Why YLDs are the real target in eye health
• Day to day function: reading, school performance, hand eye coordination, depth tasks (stairs, driving, sports, lab/technical work).
• Work and productivity: slower work, fatigue, more mistakes, limited career options that require precise depth perception.
• Mental health & social impact: lower confidence, teasing or stigma, avoiding eye contact, isolation.
• Safety risks: misjudging distance can mean falls, traffic incidents, and sports injuries.

Strabismus & amblyopia through the GBD lens
• Strabismus misaligns the eyes, so the brain receives mismatched images. To avoid double vision, it often “turns down” one eye  that suppression reduces binocular vision and stereopsis (true 3D depth).
• Amblyopia is reduced vision from the brain favoring one eye; untreated in childhood, it can become permanent.
• Both conditions rarely shorten life, but they accumulate large YLDs  years of reduced confidence, capability, and opportunity.

Good news  Eye2Eye reduces YLDs
Eye2Eye is built exactly for the part of GBD that matters most in eye care: disability time.
• Non-invasive neuromuscular training to improve binocular cooperation and reduce eyestrain and diplopia.
• Post-operation stabilization so surgical alignment keeps working in real life  less relapse, better long-term function.
• Home usable and data aware, so patients stay engaged and clinicians can monitor progress.

Why this matters to payers and partners
• Large addressable burden: shifting even a fraction of those YLDs back into healthy, productive time has outsized economic and social returns.
• Practical pathway: combine conservative training + focused post-op support to protect surgical wins and avoid repetitive re interventions.
• Human impact: better school outcomes, safer mobility, and real confidence gains that ripple through careers and communities.

Bottom line
GBD reminds us to chase the biggest wins. In eye health, that means cutting disability time  not debating mortality. Eye2Eye is designed for exactly that: less strain, better depth, steadier binocular vision, and more healthy years lived at full potential.
